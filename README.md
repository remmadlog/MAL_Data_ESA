## Project Goal
This repository serves as a **learning-by-doing** project focused on:

- Fetching anime/manga data using the Jikan API
- Cleaning and transforming raw data
- Exploring relationships between different features
- Applying clustering techniques
- Performing predictive analysis

##  Note
This is a **learning project**, not intended for production or perfection. The goal is to practice real-world data workflows and apply analytical thinking in a practical context.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **Python** (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, etc.)
- **Jikan API** for MAL data
