# MyAnimeList Data Analysis (via Jikan API)

This project explores data from [MyAnimeList (MAL)](https://myanimelist.net/) using the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/#). MAL is a social cataloging platform for anime and manga fans, offering a wide range of metadata and user-generated content.

## Project Goal
This repository serves as a **learning-by-doing** project focused on:

- Fetching anime/manga data using the Jikan API
- Cleaning and transforming raw data
- Exploring relationships between different features
- Applying clustering techniques
- Performing predictive analysis

##  Note
This is a **learning project**, not intended for production or perfection. The goal is to practice real-world data workflows and apply analytical thinking in a practical context.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **Python** (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, etc.)
- **Jikan API** for MAL data



# 1. Brief MAL Data Analysis Over Time (April 2025)

Below you'll find a **very brief** analysis of some trends in the MAL dataset. 

**Note**:  
- This analysis intentionally omits some relationships and detailed interpretations. 
- With more time and demand, much deeper insights can be extracted.
- It is meant primarily as a *learning exercise* and not a comprehensive study.
---

## Remarks
- **Engagement by year** refers to engagement **with shows from that year**, not interactions that happened **during** that year.
- The low number of shows in the early years makes it harder to draw solid conclusions.
- For entries before 2004, engagement occurred post-release, since MAL launched in November 2004.

---

## Interpretation
### Entry Growth Over Time

It’s no surprise that the number of entries has grown over time, especially in the last decade.

<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_Amount_(Shows_TV+_Movie+_Other).png" width="750">

A clear dip appears around 2020 due to COVID-19.  
- **Movies and specials** decreased.  
- **Music-related content** increased noticeably.

---

### TV, OVA, ONA Trends

<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_Amount_(TV_OVA_ONA).png" width="750">


- ONAs have exploded in recent years.  
  Titles like *Cyberpunk: Edgerunners* and *Shiguang Dailiren* are standout examples.

---

### Movie & Special Output


<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_Amount_(Movie_Special).png" width="750">

A more focused look shows the decline in movie and special releases over time.

---

### Source Material Usage

<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_Amount_SOURCE.png" width="750">

- Original works had a notable rise (and possibly a recent fall).
- Manga remains a strong, consistent source.
- Web manga and light novels are rising.
- Visual novels and traditional novels are declining.

### Performance & Score Trends

Just the number of shows doesn't tell the full story. Performance matters too.

<img src="Plots/overtime/Heatmap_average_Score_Source_TF.png" width="750">

- Original works tend to score higher in the last decade.

But scores in general have been rising:

<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_SCORE_average.png" width="750">

- The average score rose by ~0.5 points over the past 5 years.
- A 6.5 today might’ve been a 6.0 thirty years ago, but we can’t confirm without knowing when scores were given.
- Still, the score increase appears consistent, not skewed by outliers.

---

### Engagement Trends

<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_ScoredBy_average.png" width="750">

- Fewer people are scoring shows since 2015.
- Fewer than half of all shows are scored by more than 5,000 users.

Other engagement metrics follow similar trends:

<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_OnList_average.png" width="750">
<img src="Plots/overtime/YEAR_FAVORITES_average.png" width="750">

- Most shows have low engagement.  
- A small number of hits drive the stats up.
- Average engagement per show has dropped since 2015, even though the total number of shows is about the same.

We can’t say overall MAL activity is lower, just that newer shows get less engagement on average.

---

### Other Notable Trends

#### Duration

<img src="Plots/overtime/Heatmap_average_Duration_Type_TF.png" width="750">

- **Movies** are longer than they used to be.
- **TV specials** are now half as long as pre-2000.
- **TV shows** stayed fairly consistent.

#### Episodes

<img src="Plots/overtime/Heatmap_average_Episodes_Type_TF.png" width="750">

- Show lengths (episode count) are down, likely due to seasonal splits.
  - e.g. *The Apothecary Diaries* S1 & S2 = ~50 episodes total, but recorded as two ~25-episode series.
- Some movies are split into multiple parts but counted under one entry.
- OVAs and ONAs resemble TV shows more than ever.

### Rating Distributions

<img src="Plots/overtime/Heatmap_TF_Rating_T.png" width="750">

- Most content now targets teens or older:
  - 50%+ rated **PG-13**
- A lange amount targets everyone:
  - ~22% have no restriction
- **R+/Rx (NSFW)** is rarer in proportion, but still increased in raw numbers.

See also:  
<img src="Plots/overtime/Heatmap_TF_Rating.png" width="750">

- 60%+ of R+/Rx content was released in the last 25 years, but total releases have also skyrocketed.

---

### Episode Lengths

<img src="Plots/overtime/Heatmap_DF_TF_T.png" width="750">

- Most entries today are either:
  - Under 5 minutes, or  
  - 20–30 minutes long.
- Short-format anime is significantly more common now.

---

## Predictions

I originally wanted to predict scores, but started by analyzing trends over time.

Here’s a **prediction of seasonal averages for 2025**, based on seasonal and yearly groupings.

Grouping by **year and season** instead of just year allowed more granular predictions (e.g. Winter 2025, Spring 2025, etc.).

**Postponed**
- I tried using ARIMA from sklearn
- only got negative r2 values
  - even using a parameter search
- not sure where I went wrong
- needs more investigating, will skip this for now

---

## Conclusion
The MAL dataset provides a depp insight in the development and propularity of anime over the last 25 years and gives a good idea of teh development of the last 55 years.

# 2. Brief  Genres, Themes and Studios focused analysis of the MAL dataset (May 2025)
Below you'll find a very brief analysis of the MAL dataset with a focus on genre and themes.
Studios will also be considered, but are not the main priority.

**Note**:  
- This analysis intentionally omits some relationships and detailed interpretations. 
- With more time and demand, much deeper insights can be extracted.
- It is meant primarily as a *learning exercise* and not a comprehensive study.

---

## Remarks

- **Only non-zero score entries** are considered to ensure that the analysis focuses on relevant, aired content.
- **Only completed entries** are included to avoid misleading or incomplete data, such as shows with zero episodes.
- **Solo vs. combination categorization** is applied:
  - Genres and themes often appear in combinations (e.g., *Action, Adventure, Fantasy*).
  - Studios may appear either solo or in combination with others.

---

- The last 2 years are again combinations: **Action**, **Adventure** and **Fantasy**.

- I am **unsure** about the impact of the studio part,
- - there is **often** **just 1 entry**.
- **Themes** are all over the place and are **not well tracked**.
- **Suspense** and **Drama** as genres doing very well in general.


## Conclusion
- **Genres** are **well tracked** and can give us a good idea of what to expect.
- They can provide an **indication of scoring**.
- **Themes** are **not well tracked**.
- There are **to many studios** for me to have an impactful conclusion.
- - **Toei Animation**, **Madhouse**, **A-1 Pictures** and **Shaft** **doing well**, but this is **no surprise**.
- **The whole consideration of genres, themes and studios could have been done better, there is a lot of room for improvement on my end, maybe I will visit this in the futur.**



# 3. Brief Score-Oriented Analysis of the MAL Dataset (May 2025)

This is a brief, exploratory analysis of the **MyAnimeList (MAL)** dataset, with a specific focus on *score-related patterns*. 
While the dataset offers many possibilities for deeper insights, the goal here is not exhaustive analysis but rather to **gain familiarity with data tools** through a focused learning project.


---

## Remarks

- **Only non-zero score entries** are considered to ensure that the analysis focuses on relevant, aired content.
- **Only completed entries** are included to avoid misleading or incomplete data, such as shows with zero episodes.

- Titles with **higher numbers of ratings** tend to have **scores above 7**.
- Entries with **fewer user ratings** are spread across the entire score range, indicating less consensus or lower visibility.

#### Score vs. Number of Users with the Entry on Their List

<img src="Plots/score/scatter_score_on_list_normalized.png" width="750">

- A similar trend holds: **widely-listed entries tend to score higher**.
- Less-listed entries again show a broader spread of scores.

#### Score vs. Favorites

<img src="Plots/score/scatter_score_scored_by_normalized.png" width="750">

- The **most highly rated entries** are also **most frequently marked as favorites**.
- This is expected, as users are likely to favorite shows they rate highly.

#### Score vs. Duration

<img src="Plots/score/scatter_score_duration_normalized.png" width="750">

- Longer-duration shows tend to score higher overall.
- Manual clustering reveals:
  - Short-duration entries (likely Music) mostly score between **4–8**.
  - Typical TV-length shows (~23 mins) score between **5.5–9**.
  - Longer content (e.g., movies) tend to perform even better, possibly due to higher production quality or targeted marketing.

### Confirmation by considering Mean score

**Scored by**:
<img src="Plots/score/plt_scored_by_score_normalized.png" width="750">

**On list**:
<img src="Plots/score/plt_on_list_score_normalized.png" width="750">

**Favorites**:
<img src="Plots/score/plt_favorites_score_normalized.png" width="750">

**Duration**:
<img src="Plots/score/plt_duration_score_normalized.png" width="750">

- the average score tends to be quit high if the amount or duration is high
- - remember, I do not think that this is surprising
- - - good shows will be put on lists since people watched it, or want to watch it
- - - an entry that is favorite by a lot of persons is likely to be rated higher, why else should so many people favorite it
- - - good shows are watched by more people, and so they are scored by more people


### Exception: Episode Count


<img src="Plots/score/plt_scored_by_score_normalized.png" width="750">

- High episode count **does not correlate** with higher scores.
- In fact, many top-scoring entries have **fewer than 13 episodes**, often standard cour lengths.
- - after shows with less than 4 episodes ~10485, shows around 10-13 episodes ~3158 make the majority of entries

<img src="Plots/score/scatter_score_episodes_normalized.png" width="750">

- The **highest scoring entries** tend to have **relatively few episodes**.
- For context: the entry with the most episodes is *3000 Whys of Blue Cat* with **3057 episodes**.
