Maybe all ToDos:
__supply_module__
ToDo:
    IMPORTANT
        -- extend the download of anime_types!
            -- At least this
                -- TV = TV show, BUT OVA and ONA are also shows but not broadcast to tv
            -- Maybe this too but not as important
                -- Move = Theater/TV, BUT Special is also a Movie!
    - OTHER
        -- info logging
            -- more/better logging (low priority)
        -- Main comment
            -- "forum" ONLY returns the NEWEST 15 entries (not really usable except for checking existence in order to measure engagement)
        -- better implementation
            -- additional pages
            -- update
        -- better functions
            -- download this id (basic and all)
            -- download this season
            -- download this year
            -- update options
            --

__creation_module__
ToDo:
    - URGENT
        -- creating list by id_full and co
            -- The smart way!
    - IMPORTANT
        -- Fist column of tables created by "get_table_season" is odd
        -- logging
        -- SPECIAL and OVA consideration!
    - OTHER
        -- In get_table_season()
            -- consider commented creation of:
                    studio_list, genre_list, theme_list
               delete and or write different function
        -- efficiency
            -- df creation ist very slow (rethink the process)
        -- try: except:
            -- using a cheap solution atm - Change that!
    - FUTUR
        -- Additional tables
            -- Season [TV, Movie, Averages...]
            -- VAs [shows, scores_average, season, year...]

__thoughts__
    -- TV, OVA, ONA - Movie, Special
        -- They are all importente (shows - movies)
